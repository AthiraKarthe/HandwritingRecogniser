# HandwritingRecogniser
I am trying to build a handwriting recogniser for my final ear project. As the name suggests the project involves building an neural network that could recognise the handwritten text in a photo and convert it into .txt format. 
TO BEGIN WITH:
The model must be able to detect the part of the image that contatins text and isolate it.
This isolated part of the image is then segmented into sentences, sentences into words, and finall words into letters. The letters are then fed into a classifier which identifies the letter in the input image and outputs a letter. This is continued until the entire image is processed and identified.
## Inspiration 
Google translator has been a great piece of inspiration to this project. 
## Progress level
I have progressed only the first part where the image is preprocessed and the part of the image that contains the text is isolated.
## Future plans:
Once this project is successfully completed. I intend to create a model by reversing the one above to create handwritten text from digital text. And that sounds fun;)
